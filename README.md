Loan Prediction using Python: Exploratory Analysis and Machine Learning

Loan Prediction using Python is a project that aims to develop an accurate model for predicting loan status. The project involves various techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing (cleaning, transformation, feature selection, encoding), and the utilization of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm to assess prediction accuracy.

The selected variables for the prediction model include 'principal', 'terms', 'effective_date', 'due_date', 'education', 'gender', 'age', and 'loan_status'. These variables play a crucial role in assessing the risk and probability of loan repayment.

The project achieves an approximate prediction accuracy of 98%.

Note: This project uses a small dataset (346 rows, 10 columns). For larger datasets, further investigation into variable relationships and data modeling is highly recommended.
